-> Python console is also known as repr (read-eval-print-repeat)
-> foo, bar, baz are metasyntactic variables
-> Every thing is object.
-> for-else loop will execute else part if for loop is exhausted and doesn't
   encounter any break statement. (same with while-else loop)
-> function will take *args as variable arguments and **kwargs will take
   keyword and arguments in function parameter.
-> It is safe to open file in 'with open(path) as file_name:' and indented block
-> Lambdas are anonymous functions
-> map, filter and reduce(from functools) are nice functions
   map                       -> map(pow, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
   filter		     -> filter(lambda x: x % 3 == 0, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
   reduce		     -> reduce(lambda x: x + y, [1, 2,3])
-> Generators are iterator but they are lazy means they generate value on demand
   (yield in function). They can be used once only and forward only.
   gen = (x*x for x in range(10)) (gen can be used one time only and generate
       	      	       		  values onyl when needed)
-> In generators __iter__() and __next__() are implemented automatically. So we
   can iterate through the items using next()
-> Like Lambda function Generator expression creates anonymous generator
   function. Generator expression syntex is same as list comprehension but they
   uses round parentheses instead of square brackets.
-> A normal function to return a sequence will make the entire sequence in
   memory before returning the result. This is an overkill if the number of
   items in the sequence is very large. Generator implementation of such
   sequence is memory friendly and is preferred since it only produces one item
   at a time.
-> Decorators provide a way to modify existing functions without changing
   original functions!
-> itertools is a nice module with functions such as
   count(parameter)          -> counting start from passed argument
   cycle(iterator)           -> cycle a iterator like list
   repeat(object [,num])     -> Repeat an object infinity time if num is not
   specified
   takewhile(arg1, arg2)     -> pick value from arg2 unitll arg1 is true
   accumulate(arg1 [,arg2])  -> accumulate entire arg1 iterator
   chain(arg1, arg2)	     -> join two list or iterator of same type
   product(arg1, arg2)	     ->	cartision product of two iterator
   permutations(arg1)	     -> return permutations of arg1 iterator
   dropwhile(arg1, arg2)     -> drop value from arg2 untill arg1 is true
-> print(args, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)
-> isinstance(object, classname)
-> object.__doc__ returns string of document of that object

-> Duck typing means assume that the user of the class is intelligent enough to
   use it correctly.
-> Attributes of an object can be created on the fly
   and can be deleted on the fly
   class Spam:
       def __init__(self, eggs = 0):
           self.eggs = eggs
       def display(self):
       	   print('eggs are: ', eggs)

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       s1 = Spam()
       s2 = Spam()
       s1.disply()
       s2.display()
       s1.attr = 5
       print(s1.attr) # Output is 5 and attr is created for s1 only
       print(s2.attr) # AttributeError attr is not definied for s2
       del(s1.attr)
       print(s1.attr) # AttributeError
       del(Spam.display)
       s1.display     # AttributeError
       s2.display     # AttributeError
-> When we delete an object of a class The name bind to that object is deleted
   not the object itself. It will be deleted only after program is called and
   destroyed by garbage collector.
-> When calling base class method from derived class use super().methodname()
-> Every class in python is derived from 'object' class and all objects are
   instance of 'object' class
-> In multiple inheritance any specific attribute is searched in the current
   class. If not found, search continues into parent class in depth-first,
   left-right fashion without searching same class twice. suppose a class

   	     +-------+	       +-------+
      	     | Base1 |         | Base2 |
	     +-------+	       +-------+
	       \		/
      	       	\	       /
       	         \	      /
        	  \	     /
	 	   \   	    /
		    \	   /
		 +--------------+   
		 | MultiDerived |
		 +--------------+

   So in the example of MultiDerived class the search order is
   [MultiDerived, Base1, Base2, object]. This order is also called linearization
   of MultiDerived class and the set of rules to find this order is also called
   Method Resolution Order (MRO) (see file inheritance.py)
-> MRO of a class can be viewed as the __mro__ attribute of mro() method. The
   former returns a tuple while the later returns a list.
-> __new__ method actually creates the instance of a class. __new__ is a static
   method while __init__ method is called after __new__ but before returning to
   the caller. __new__ create object and __init__ customize it. (see file
   new.py)
-> Suppose you have a var with the name of the attribute you want to set instead
   of just knowing the name you have to use builtin setattr or class magic
   method __setattr__, also a common use is with **kwargs
   class A:
       def __init__(**kwargs):
           for k,w in kwargs.items():
	       setattr(self, k, w)
	       # self.__setattr__(k, w)
-> Magic methods are special methods which have double underscores at the
   beginning and end of their names. They are also known as dunders.
   Their are various methods for operator overloading
   __add__   	     	     -> a + b
   __sub__		     -> a - b
   __mul__		     -> a * b
   __truediv__		     -> a / b
   __floordiv__		     -> a // b
   __lshift__		     -> a << b
   __rshift__		     -> a >> b
   __and__		     -> a & b
   __or__		     -> a | b
   __xor__		     -> a ^ b
   __invert__		     -> ~a
   __pow__		     -> a ** b
   __mod__		     -> a % b
   __lt__		     -> a < b
   __le__		     -> a <= b
   __gt__		     -> a > b
   __ge__		     -> a >= b
   __eq__		     -> a == b
   __ne__		     -> a != b (If __ne__ is not defined and __eq__ is
   			     	        defined then it will return reverse of
					__eq__)
   __len__		     -> len(a)
   __getitem__		     -> item = a[idx]
   __setitem__		     -> a[idx] = item
   __delitem__		     -> del(a)
   __iter__		     -> for iteration
   __contains__		     -> a in b
   (see file operator_overloading.py)
-> Data hiding states that implementation details of a class should be hidden,
   and a clean standard interface be presented for those who want to use the
   class. The Python philosophy is slightly different. It is often stated as
   "We are all consenting adults here", meaning that you shouldn't put
   arbitrary restrictions on accessing parts of a class.
-> Their are two types of private methods and attributes
   weekly private methods/attributes
   strongly private method/attributes
   weekly private method/attributes have one underscore in front of their end.
   This is just a convention but it will produce only one effect, that is
   'from module_name import *' won't bring variable that start with a single
   underscore.
   Strongly private method/attribute have a double underscore at the beginning
   of their names. This causes their names to be mangled, which means that they
   can't be accessed from outside the class. They can be used with convention
   object._Classname__method_name()
   class Spam:
       __egg = 7
       def print_egg(self):
           print(self.__egg)
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       s = Spam()
       s.print_egg()
       print(s._Spam__egg)
       print(s.__egg) # AttributeError
   (see file private.py)
-> To reload a module in python2 use 'reload(module_name)' however in python3
   reload become 'imp.reload(module_name)'. In python3.4 imp is deprecated and
   reload is added into package importlib so now you have to use
   import importlib
   importlib.reload(module_name)
-> class methods and other simple methods are methods which are bound to the
   class while static methods are plain old methods which does not bounded.
   class methods are defined with decorator '@classmethod' and takes first
   argument as cls while static methods are defined with decorator
   '@staticmethod' and they does not take any additional argument.
-> Iterator in python is simply an object that can be iterated upon. A object
   which will return data, one element at a time. Python iterator object must
   implemented two special methods, __iter__() and __next__(), collectively
   called the iterator protocol.
   lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   itr = iter(lst)
   next(itr) # 1
   next(itr) # 2
   itr.__next__() # 3
-> for loop can iterate over any iterable. Simple implementation of for loop is
   for element in iterable

   same as

   itr_obj = iter(iterable)
   while True:
       try:
           element = next(itr_obj)
	   # do some thing
       except StopIteration:
           break

   Ironically, for loop iteself uses infinity while loop.
   (see file my_own_iter.py)
-> A closure occurs when a function has access to a local variable from an
   enclosing scope that has finished its execution.
   def make_printter(msg):
       def printer():
           print(msg)
       return printer
   my_printer = make_printer('Foo!')
   my_printer()
   When make_printer is called, a new Frame is put on the Stack with the
   Compiled code for the printer function as a contant and the value of msg as a
   local. It then creates and returns the function. Because the function printer
   references the msg variable, it is kept alive after the make_printer function
   has returned.
   When do we have closure:
   - We must have a nested function.
   - The nested function must refer to a value defined in the enclosing function
   - The enclosing function must return the nested function.
-> Values that get enclosed in the closure function can be found out. All
   function objects have a __closure__ attribute that returns a tuple of cell
   objects if it is a closure function.
   inner_function_name.__closure__[0].cell_contents # it will give the first
   						      enclosing elements
   (see file closure.py)
-> Decorators add functionality to an existing code. This is also called
   metaprogramming as a part of the program tries to modify another part of the
   program at compile time. A decorator is a callable that returns a callable.
   Basically, a decorator takes in a function, adds some functionality and
   returns it.
-> Multiple decorators can be chained. (see file decorator_explored.py)
-> Properties provides a way of customizing access to instance attributes.
   (see file properties.py)
